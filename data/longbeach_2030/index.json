    "vision_statement": "ALL PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES IN LONG BEACH have access to quality education across the life span to learn and grow, have economic opportunity, have access to technology to learn, communicate, engage and thrive, have housing that is safe, inviting, fully accessible and affordable, are safe and secure in their neighbourhoods, have mobility and infrastructure that is safe and meets their needs, are healthy and well, and live in a sustainable and resilient environment.",

      "equity": "Equity is when everyone can reach their highest level of health and potential for a successful life, regardless of their background and identity. We envision a Long Beach where a person's zip code or identity does not determine the opportunities they and their families have for a healthy and prosperous life.",
      "resiliency": "Resiliency is the capacity of individuals, families, communities, and our government to heal from trauma, and strengthen our adaptability and experiences of wellbeing in ways that can prevent future trauma. It also focuses on our systems' capacity to absorb stresses, shocks and changes stemming from ecological, social and economic impacts and maintain function in the face of external stresses imposed upon it."
