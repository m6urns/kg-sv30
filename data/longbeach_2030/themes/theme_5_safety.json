      "overview": "The vision for a safer Long Beach begins with strong and connected families, education that meets the needs of everyone, and diverse workforce pathways and employment. In furtherance of the community's overall wellness, the City will support forward-thinking public safety agencies that enhance public safety through partnerships to include innovation, collaboration, and engagement. From policy writing to program implementation, the departments promoting public safety will incorporate community feedback and seek partnerships to better the City. The departments will reflect the communities they serve and have a myriad of alternative crisis response teams to ensure each call has a tailored response prioritizing wellness and safety of all. A safer Long Beach is also one that is prepared to handle any unplanned disasters and all emergencies that arise. This requires engagement of residents, community-based organizations, and government systems working together to address social impacts that can improve overall safety and wellness. The following recommendations encourage building strategic relationships, promoting community wellness, updating government policies, increasing investments in youth, and ensuring all City staff are prepared for the next shock or stressor as they emerge. These strategies build both individual and community resilience through planning, prevention, intervention, and community building.",
